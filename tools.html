            <p>These are tools that we've written to help us write this documentation.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/irccom">Docker Images</a></h3>
            <p>We host a series of Docker images <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/irccom">available here</a> (source <a href="https://github.com/irccom/test-servers">here</a>) with different IRC server software running. These images are setup with consistent configurations, oper credentials, and port numbers to speed-up testing.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/irccom/script-runner">Script Runner</a></h3>
            <p>We've written an IRC script runner <a href="https://github.com/irccom/script-runner">available here</a> which makes it simple to run a set of commands and actions across different IRC servers, then output a file for easy comparison between the tested servers.</p>

            <h2><div class="docs-list-linker" id="external"></div><a href="#external">External Tools</a></h2>
            <p>These are tools written by others in the IRC community, which we also make use of.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/ircdocs/parser-tests">Parser Tests</a></h3>
            <p>The set of test files <a href="https://github.com/ircdocs/parser-tests">available here</a> let developers test IRC parsers and uncover areas where they do not parse (particularly complicated or edge-case) messages or incoming lines correctly.</p>
