# IRC Developer Docs
This set of documentation is hosted by IRC.com, describing the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) protocol in detail. The docs here are written to give developers a good footing when writing software that uses or interacts with IRC.

This documentation takes on a lot of structure from something like the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), which documents web technology instead.


## Building
Primarily, these docs are meant to be plugged into the proper IRC.com website. However, when developing that's irritating to do so instead we support building the site in two different modes – `dev` and `prod`.

In `dev` mode, the site will build a basic browsable version that can be viewed through the server that Jekyll sets up. In `prod` mode, what's output is instead the HTML and files that get plugged into the IRC.com site.

**dev**
```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve -w --config _config-dev.yml
```

**prod**
```sh
bundle exec jekyll b --config _config-prod.yml
```


## Documentation Structure
Here's the rough breakdown of what's included here:

- Tech References
    - Command Reference
    - Numeric Reference
    - Glossary
- Guides


### Future
Some stuff I want to describe very explicitly in future include:

- Hostname masking/cloaking
- Virtual Hosts
- `refs/modes/c/invite-only` and etc, `modes/c` for chan and `modes/u` for user modes, check the `join` command ref for links
- `refs/isupport/chanlimit` and etc


## Other References
Here are some other IRC references that devs may find useful:

- [IRCv3 Working Group](https://ircv3.net/)
- [ircdocs](http://ircdocs.horse/)


## What can I do with this?

The project's [license file](./LICENSE) lays this out in detail, but as a non-normative summary we've designed the license so that:

- If anyone modifies or builds on top of the content in this repo, we can pull those changes back into this project under this project's license.
- If anyone wants to take any of the content in this repo and pull it into the IETF process (for example, writing a new RFC describing the IRC protocol), they can do that and the content they use will be under the IETF contributor license terms.
